Library is mostly complete but these things could be 
implemented and added:

> must add docs

file:
    - function declarations and stuff should be in same order

structures:
    - heaps
    - tries
    - suffix arrays
    - sets
    - segment trees
    - decision trees
    - matrices
    - more linked list types
    - red black trees
    - avl trees 
    - bitmaps
    - graphs
    - chad string
    - sqrt decomposition
    - bitset
    - pairs
    - priority queues
    - bitmasks
    - binary tree
    - fenwick/binary indexed tree

functions & algorithms:
    - math
    - common graph algorithms
    - searching algorithms
    - sorting algorithms
    - string parsing
    - reg ex
    - file io
    - json parsing
    - network file access
    - coroutines
    - threads
